## üìå About the Project

The **Property Management System (PMS)** is a complete solution for **real estate and property management** that includes:

- **3 Web Dashboards**:
  - **Admin & Supervisors Dashboard** for managing system operations, approvals, financials, complaints, and monitoring statistics
  - **Brokers / Office Managers Dashboard** for managing offices, properties, bookings, payments, and advertisements

- **Role-based permissions** with secure authentication
- **Payment and invoicing system** supporting online and manual payments

### üè† Entry Point (Landing Single Page)

When accessing the platform for the first time, users are welcomed with a **landing single page** that showcases:

- **Top 5 Brokers/Offices**
- **Top 5 Service Providers**
- **Contributors/Developers** who worked on the project

From this entry page, the user can decide to either:

- **Visit the Mobile Application** to explore properties and tourist places as an end-user
- **Join as a Broker (Office Manager) or Service Provider** by submitting office/service details along with a verification document.
  - The request is then sent to the **Admin Dashboard** for review and can be **approved or rejected**.

The system is built using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** for scalability and maintainability.
